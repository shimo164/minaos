Task:
Review text and look for typos following these rules.
- Find spelling mistakes(typos), in English and Japanese
- Check for inconsistent usage of long vowel marks (ー) in katakana words.
For example, "ユーザー" and "ユーザ" should not be mixed—only one form should be used consistently throughout the text.
- Check for inconsistent capitalization of words — for example, "Tag" and "tag" should not be mixed. Use a consistent casing throughout the text.
- Identify words that should be in plural form based on context but are written in singular form.
For example, if the sentence refers to multiple items but uses "file" instead of "files", flag it as inconsistent.
- Write before and after changes concisely and limit 20 characters
- If the same mistake appears multiple times, indicate it as "複数: X箇所"
- If there is no changes, output "修正箇所はありません"

Exclude:
- where to put punctuation
- where english words are written in katakana
- kanji variation
- spaces between numbers/words
- missing spaces

Format:
修正前: AAAA
修正後: BBBB
複数: X箇所 (if exist multiple times per mistake)
-- (use "--" as delimiter)
